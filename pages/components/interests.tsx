          Besides developing new things and testing new technologies, I really
          like meeting new places, seeing new people and whenever I have the
          chance I try to travel somewhere totally different from the other.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          When I'm at home I really enjoy watching shows and movies, my favorite
          genres are drama, horror, historical and a bit of science fiction.
